## Resolved

The following former blockers have been addressed:

- ✅ **Python 3 compatibility** — all Python 2 syntax removed (`types.StringType`, `unicode()`, `raise X, msg`, bare `except:`, etc.)
- ✅ **Artist–title filename parsing** — `FilenameParser` handles "Artist - Title" and legacy dash formats
- ✅ **DIVX/XVID scanning** — `.divx` and `.xvid` added to `MpgExtensions`
- ✅ **ZIP inner-path parsing** — `SongStruct` now uses `ZipStoredName` for artist/title extraction
- ✅ **Security hardening** — `shell=True` removed from subprocess calls; `eval()` replaced with `ast.literal_eval()`

## Open Work

### Integration
